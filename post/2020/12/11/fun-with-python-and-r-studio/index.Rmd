Although Python and R-Studio are both great computing softwares alone, they are especially great when you can get them to talk to one another! I am a new car owner and thought it would be fun to explore some car data collected from cars in the U.S.. Today, I will use R and Python to determine the mean mpg from a sample of cars.

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
library(datasets)
cars<-mtcars
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
r.cars.mpg.mean()
```

My car has an average of 28 mpg, which is actually above average! Because of this, I thought I would finish off this blog post with a gorgeous stock photo of my car.
