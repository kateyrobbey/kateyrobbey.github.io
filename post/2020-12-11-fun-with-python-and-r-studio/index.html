<p>Although Python and R-Studio are both great computing softwares alone, they are especially great when you can get them to talk to one another! I am a new car owner and thought it would be fun to explore some car data collected from cars in the U.S.. Today, I will use R and Python to determine the mean mpg from a sample of cars.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
library(datasets)
cars&lt;-mtcars</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>#Python code chunk
r.cars.mpg.mean()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 20.090625000000003</code></pre>
<p>My car has an average of 28 mpg, which is actually above average! Because of this, I thought I would finish off this blog post with a gorgeous stock photo of my car.</p>
